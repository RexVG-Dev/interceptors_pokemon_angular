## Interceptors

 Interceptors are a powerful tool used for handling HTTP requests and responses. They act as middleware that can intercept outgoing requests and incoming responses, allowing to perform various tasks such as modifying headers, logging, caching, or error handling.  
 Interceptors are implemented as services that can be injected into Angular application's HTTP client module.

Also could be used to transform data, handle errors, and handle toast notifications.

1. **Modify Requests:** Intercept outgoing HTTP requests and modify them before they are sent. This could involve adding authentication headers, appending tokens, or altering the request body.

2. **Handle Responses:** Interceptors can intercept incoming HTTP responses before they are passed to the calling code. This allows for centralized error handling, logging, or transforming responses before they reach the component.

3. **Error Handling:** Intercepting responses also enables centralized error handling. Catch errors, log them, and handle them in a uniform manner across.

4. **Logging:** Interceptors are excellent for logging HTTP requests and responses. It can log request details, response data, and errors to aid in debugging and monitoring.

5. **Caching:** Implementing caching logic within interceptors allows you to cache responses and avoid redundant network requests, improving performance.
